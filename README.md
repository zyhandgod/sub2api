## Overview

Sub2API is an AI API gateway platform designed to distribute and manage API quotas from AI product subscriptions. Users can access upstream AI services through platform-generated API Keys, while the platform handles authentication, billing, load balancing, and request forwarding.

## Features

- **Multi-Account Management** - Support multiple upstream account types (OAuth, API Key)
- **API Key Distribution** - Generate and manage API Keys for users
- **Precise Billing** - Token-level usage tracking and cost calculation
- **Smart Scheduling** - Intelligent account selection with sticky sessions
- **Concurrency Control** - Per-user and per-account concurrency limits
- **Rate Limiting** - Configurable request and token rate limits
- **Built-in Payment System** - Supports EasyPay, Alipay, WeChat Pay, and Stripe for user self-service top-up, no separate payment service needed ([Configuration Guide](docs/PAYMENT.md))
- **Admin Dashboard** - Web interface for monitoring and management
- **External System Integration** - Embed external systems (e.g. ticketing) via iframe to extend the admin dashboard

## Ecosystem

Community projects that extend or integrate with Sub2API:

| Project | Description | Features |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| ~~[Sub2ApiPay](https://github.com/touwaeriol/sub2apipay)~~ | ~~Self-service payment system~~ | **Now Built-in** — Payment is now integrated into Sub2API, no separate deployment needed. See [Payment Configuration Guide](docs/PAYMENT.md) |
| [sub2api-mobile](https://github.com/ckken/sub2api-mobile) | Mobile admin console | Cross-platform app (iOS/Android/Web) for user management, account management, monitoring dashboard, and multi-backend switching; built with Expo + React Native |

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | Go 1.25.7, Gin, Ent |
| Frontend | Vue 3.4+, Vite 5+, TailwindCSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15+ |
| Cache/Queue | Redis 7+ |

---

## Nginx Reverse Proxy Note

When using Nginx as a reverse proxy for Sub2API (or CRS) with Codex CLI, add the following to the `http` block in your Nginx configuration:

```nginx
underscores_in_headers on;
```

Nginx drops headers containing underscores by default (e.g. `session_id`), which breaks sticky session routing in multi-account setups.

---

## Deployment

### Method 1: Script Installation (Recommended)

One-click installation script that downloads pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases.

#### Prerequisites

- Linux server (amd64 or arm64)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (installed and running)
- Redis 7+ (installed and running)
- Root privileges

#### Installation Steps

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The script will:
1. Detect your system architecture
2. Download the latest release
3. Install binary to `/opt/sub2api`
4. Create systemd service
5. Configure system user and permissions

#### Post-Installation

```bash
# 1. Start the service
sudo systemctl start sub2api

# 2. Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable sub2api

# 3. Open Setup Wizard in browser
# http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080
```

The Setup Wizard will guide you through:
- Database configuration
- Redis configuration
- Admin account creation

#### Upgrade

You can upgrade directly from the **Admin Dashboard** by clicking the **Check for Updates** button in the top-left corner.

The web interface will:
- Check for new versions automatically
- Download and apply updates with one click
- Support rollback if needed

#### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status sub2api

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u sub2api -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart sub2api

# Uninstall
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- uninstall -y
```

---

### Method 2: Docker Compose (Recommended)

Deploy with Docker Compose, including PostgreSQL and Redis containers.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2+

#### Quick Start (One-Click Deployment)

Use the automated deployment script for easy setup:

```bash
# Create deployment directory
mkdir -p sub2api-deploy && cd sub2api-deploy

# Download and run deployment preparation script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api/main/deploy/docker-deploy.sh | bash

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f sub2api
```

**What the script does:**
- Downloads `docker-compose.local.yml` (saved as `docker-compose.yml`) and `.env.example`
- Generates secure credentials (JWT_SECRET, TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY, POSTGRES_PASSWORD)
- Creates `.env` file with auto-generated secrets
- Creates data directories (uses local directories for easy backup/migration)
- Displays generated credentials for your reference

#### Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api.git
cd sub2api/deploy

# 2. Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env

# 3. Edit configuration (generate secure passwords)
nano .env
```

**Required configuration in `.env`:**

```bash
# PostgreSQL password (REQUIRED)
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# JWT Secret (RECOMMENDED - keeps users logged in after restart)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# TOTP Encryption Key (RECOMMENDED - preserves 2FA after restart)
TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_totp_key_here

# Optional: Admin account
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password

# Optional: Custom port
SERVER_PORT=8080
```

**Generate secure secrets:**
```bash
# Generate JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate POSTGRES_PASSWORD
openssl rand -hex 32
```

```bash
# 4. Create data directories (for local version)
mkdir -p data postgres_data redis_data

# 5. Start all services
# Option A: Local directory version (recommended - easy migration)
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

# Option B: Named volumes version (simple setup)
docker compose up -d

# 6. Check status
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps

# 7. View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f sub2api
```

#### Deployment Versions

| Version | Data Storage | Migration | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **docker-compose.local.yml** | Local directories | ✅ Easy (tar entire directory) | Production, frequent backups |
| **docker-compose.yml** | Named volumes | ⚠️ Requires docker commands | Simple setup |

**Recommendation:** Use `docker-compose.local.yml` (deployed by script) for easier data management.

#### Access

Open `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080` in your browser.

If admin password was auto-generated, find it in logs:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs sub2api | grep "admin password"
```

#### Upgrade

```bash
# Pull latest image and recreate container
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

#### Easy Migration (Local Directory Version)

When using `docker-compose.local.yml`, migrate to a new server easily:

```bash
# On source server
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
cd ..
tar czf sub2api-complete.tar.gz sub2api-deploy/

# Transfer to new server
scp sub2api-complete.tar.gz user@new-server:/path/

# On new server
tar xzf sub2api-complete.tar.gz
cd sub2api-deploy/
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

#### Useful Commands

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down

# Restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml restart

# View all logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f

# Remove all data (caution!)
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
rm -rf data/ postgres_data/ redis_data/
```

---

### Method 3: Apple container (macOS)

Apple-silicon Macs running macOS 26 can run the full Sub2API, PostgreSQL, and Redis stack with Apple `container` 1.1.0 or newer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api.git
cd sub2api/deploy
./apple-container.sh init
./apple-container.sh up
./apple-container.sh status
```

This is an operator-managed local workflow; Docker Compose remains the recommended production path. See [deploy/APPLE_CONTAINER.md](deploy/APPLE_CONTAINER.md) for lifecycle commands, persistence, upgrades, and runtime limitations.

### Sora Status (Temporarily Unavailable)

> ⚠️ Sora-related features are temporarily unavailable due to technical issues in upstream integration and media delivery.
> Please do not rely on Sora in production at this time.
> Existing `gateway.sora_*` configuration keys are reserved and may not take effect until these issues are resolved.

Additional security-related options are available in `config.yaml`:

- `cors.allowed_origins` for CORS allowlist
- `security.url_allowlist` for upstream/pricing/CRS host allowlists
- `security.url_allowlist.enabled` to disable URL validation (use with caution)
- `security.url_allowlist.allow_insecure_http` to allow HTTP URLs when validation is disabled
- `security.url_allowlist.allow_private_hosts` to allow private/local IP addresses
- `security.response_headers.enabled` to enable configurable response header filtering (disabled uses default allowlist)
- `security.csp` to control Content-Security-Policy headers
- `billing.circuit_breaker` to fail closed on billing errors
- `server.trusted_proxies` to enable X-Forwarded-For parsing
- `turnstile.required` to require Turnstile in release mode

**⚠️ Security Warning: HTTP URL Configuration**

When `security.url_allowlist.enabled=false`, the system performs minimal URL validation and **allows HTTP URLs by default** (dev-friendly mode; Docker Compose deployments use the same default). For production, explicitly tighten this to HTTPS-only:

```yaml
security:
  url_allowlist:
    enabled: false                # Disable allowlist checks
    allow_insecure_http: false    # HTTPS only (recommended for production)
```

**Or via environment variable:**

```bash
SECURITY_URL_ALLOWLIST_ENABLED=false
SECURITY_URL_ALLOWLIST_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=false
```

**Risks of allowing HTTP:**
- API keys and data transmitted in **plaintext** (vulnerable to interception)
- Susceptible to **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**
- **NOT suitable for production** environments

**When to use HTTP:**
- ✅ Development/testing with local servers (http://localhost)
- ✅ Internal networks with trusted endpoints
- ✅ Testing account connectivity before obtaining HTTPS
- ❌ Production environments (use HTTPS only)

**Example error for HTTP URLs when `allow_insecure_http: false` is set:**
```
Invalid base URL: invalid url scheme: http
```

If you disable URL validation or response header filtering, harden your network layer:
- Enforce an egress allowlist for upstream domains/IPs
- Block private/loopback/link-local ranges
- Enforce TLS-only outbound traffic
- Strip sensitive upstream response headers at the proxy

#### OpenAI Responses WebSocket ingress limits

`gateway.openai_ws` bounds the lifetime and aggregate count of client-facing
Responses WebSocket sessions. These safeguards apply independently from
per-turn user and account concurrency slots, which are released between turns.

```yaml
gateway:
  openai_ws:
    # Total time to receive and decompress the first client message.
    client_first_message_timeout_seconds: 30
    # Close a client socket idle between completed turns; 0 disables this safeguard.
    ingress_inter_turn_idle_timeout_seconds: 300
    # Distributed API-key limit for live client ingress sessions; 0 disables it.
    max_ingress_connections_per_api_key: 64
```

The first-message timeout is a total read deadline. Deployments that accept
large contexts or image-heavy requests over slower links can raise it to
120-300 seconds. It expires before HTTP bridge routing, so bridge mode does not
override this limit.

The connection cap is coordinated through Redis using a 60-second lease that
is refreshed every 20 seconds. A process that cannot confirm a lease for a
full lease lifetime closes its local WebSocket rather than continuing outside
the global cap. Use `http_bridge` for client-WebSocket/upstream-HTTP operation
when rolling out or mitigating upstream WebSocket issues.

#### ⚠️ Important: Creating the Admin Account

The initial admin account is **only created via the setup wizard** (served at `http://<host>:8080` on first run). The `default.admin_email` / `default.admin_password` fields in `config.yaml` are **not used** to create it — they exist in the template for historical reasons.

Because step 5 above pre-creates `config.yaml`, the setup wizard will be **skipped on first run**: the server detects an existing config and boots straight into normal mode with an empty `users` table, so the first login attempt fails with `invalid email or password`.

**Two ways to create the admin account:**

1. **Recommended — let the wizard generate `config.yaml`:** Skip step 5 (do not run the `cp`). Start `./sub2api` directly; the setup wizard at `http://localhost:8080` walks you through database, Redis, and admin account setup, then writes `config.yaml` for you.

2. **If you already created `config.yaml`:** Temporarily move it aside so the wizard can trigger on first run, then restore it afterwards:
   ```bash
   mv config.yaml config.yaml.bak
   ./sub2api        # wizard runs at http://localhost:8080 and writes a fresh config.yaml
   # stop the server (Ctrl+C) once the wizard completes, then restore your config:
   mv config.yaml.bak config.yaml
   ./sub2api        # restart in normal mode and log in with the admin you just created
   ```

```bash
# 6. Run the application
./sub2api
```

#### Development Mode

```bash
# Backend (with hot reload)
cd backend
go run ./cmd/server

# Frontend (with hot reload)
cd frontend
pnpm run dev
```

#### Code Generation

When editing `backend/ent/schema`, regenerate Ent + Wire:

```bash
cd backend
go generate ./ent
go generate ./cmd/server
```

## Simple Mode

Simple Mode is designed for individual developers or internal teams who want quick access without full SaaS features.

- Enable: Set environment variable `RUN_MODE=simple`
- Difference: Hides SaaS-related features and skips billing process
- Security note: In production, you must also set `SIMPLE_MODE_CONFIRM=true` to allow startup

## Grok / xAI Support

Sub2API supports both Grok subscription accounts through xAI OAuth and standard xAI API-key accounts. Both account types forward OpenAI-compatible Responses traffic to xAI.

### Supported Scope

- Platform name: `grok`
- Account types: OAuth subscription accounts and xAI API-key accounts
- Public Responses targets: `/v1/responses`, `/responses`, and `/backend-api/codex/responses`, forwarded to the Grok subscription proxy for OAuth accounts or `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses` for API-key accounts
- Public Claude-compatible target: `/v1/messages`, converted to xAI Responses and returned as Anthropic Messages output for Claude CLI style clients
- Public Chat Completions targets: `/v1/chat/completions` and `/chat/completions`, forwarded to the account-type-specific xAI upstream
- Codex CLI style Responses WebSocket ingress is accepted on the Responses targets and bridged to xAI HTTP/SSE Responses upstream
- Text models: `grok-4.5`, `grok-4.3`, `grok-build-0.1`, `grok-composer-2.5-fast`, `grok-4.20-0309-reasoning`, `grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning`, and `grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309`
- Media targets for Grok groups: `/v1/images/generations`, `/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits`, `/images/edits`, `/v1/videos/generations`, `/videos/generations`, `/v1/videos/edits`, `/videos/edits`, `/v1/videos/extensions`, `/videos/extensions`, `/v1/videos/{request_id}`, and `/videos/{request_id}`. Generation, editing, and extension requests require the group image-generation permission.
- Media models: `grok-imagine`, `grok-imagine-image-quality`, `grok-imagine-image`, `grok-imagine-edit`, `grok-imagine-video`, and `grok-imagine-video-1.5`
- Out of scope for this provider: TTS, transcription, browser automation, cookies, and Grok web scraping

### OAuth Configuration

The Grok OAuth flow uses PKCE and does not require committing private secrets. The default client details follow the public xAI OAuth flow used by compatible clients, and every value can be overridden by environment variable:

| Variable | Default |
|----------|---------|
| `XAI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | Public xAI OAuth client ID |
| `XAI_OAUTH_SCOPE` | `openid profile email offline_access grok-cli:access api:access` |
| `XAI_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` | `http://127.0.0.1:56121/callback` |
| `XAI_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL` | `https://auth.x.ai/oauth2/authorize` |
| `XAI_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL` | `https://auth.x.ai/oauth2/token` |
| `XAI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.x.ai/v1`; runtime-diagnostics override (account `base_url` controls request forwarding) |
| `XAI_GROK_CLI_VERSION` | `0.2.93`; optional override for the client identity sent to `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com` |

Administrators can create Grok OAuth or API-key accounts from the dashboard. OAuth authorization and reauthorization are also available through the admin API:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/v1/admin/grok/oauth/auth-url` | Generate an xAI OAuth authorization URL |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/grok/oauth/exchange-code` | Exchange a callback URL, query string, or code for OAuth credentials |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/grok/oauth/refresh-token` | Validate or refresh a Grok refresh token |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/grok/accounts/:id/refresh` | Refresh an existing Grok account |

OAuth credential storage reuses the existing account JSON fields: `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `token_type`, `expires_at`, `base_url`, optional `email`, optional `subscription_tier`, and `entitlement_status`. OAuth inference defaults to `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1`; existing OAuth accounts that stored the old `https://api.x.ai/v1` default are redirected to the subscription proxy at runtime. Explicit custom upstreams remain unchanged.

For API-key accounts, select **Grok → API Key** in the create-account dialog. The official base URL defaults to `https://api.x.ai/v1`; credentials use the existing `base_url` and `api_key` account fields. OAuth accounts continue to use the subscription flow above.

### Grok Build CLI Configuration

1. In the Sub2API admin dashboard, add either a `grok` OAuth account and complete xAI authorization, or add a Grok API-key account.
2. Create a Grok group, attach the account to it, then create a Sub2API API key assigned to that group.
3. In the user API-key page, click **Use Key** and select **Grok CLI**. The modal generates the correct file and base URL for macOS/Linux or Windows. It also provides an OpenCode configuration on the **OpenCode** tab.
4. If configuring manually, save the following as `~/.grok/config.toml` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.grok\config.toml`):

```toml
[models]
default = "grok"
web_search = "grok"

[model."grok"]
model = "grok-4.5"
base_url = "https://your-sub2api.example.com/v1"
name = "Grok 4.5"
api_key = "sk-your-sub2api-key"
api_backend = "responses"
context_window = 1000000
supports_backend_search = true
```

Back up an existing `config.toml` before merging the entry. The file contains a Sub2API API key, so keep it private and restrict its permissions where supported. Verify the effective configuration and make a smoke request:

```bash
grok inspect
grok -p "Reply with sub2api-ok" -m grok
```

The `base_url` above is the public Sub2API URL ending in `/v1`, not `api.x.ai` or the internal xAI OAuth proxy URL.

### Usage And Quota Display

xAI quota is passive. Sub2API does not invent subscription quota values; it records whitelisted xAI rate-limit headers from successful or rate-limited upstream responses when xAI sends them. Before the first usable upstream response, the dashboard shows quota as unknown and still displays local Sub2API usage stats.

`401` responses temporarily remove accounts with invalid credentials from scheduling. `403` responses are treated as access or entitlement failures instead of token-refresh loops. `429` responses use `Retry-After` or a short cooldown to temporarily remove the account from scheduling.

---

## Antigravity Support

Sub2API supports [Antigravity](https://antigravity.so/) accounts. After authorization, dedicated endpoints are available for Claude and Gemini models.

### Dedicated Endpoints

| Endpoint | Model |
|----------|-------|
| `/antigravity/v1/messages` | Claude models |
| `/antigravity/v1beta/` | Gemini models |

### Claude Code Configuration

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080/antigravity"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="sk-xxx"
```

### Hybrid Scheduling Mode

Antigravity accounts support optional **hybrid scheduling**. When enabled, the general endpoints `/v1/messages` and `/v1beta/` will also route requests to Antigravity accounts.

> **⚠️ Warning**: Anthropic Claude and Antigravity Claude **cannot be mixed within the same conversation context**. Use groups to isolate them properly.
